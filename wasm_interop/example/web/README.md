# Example Usage of The `wai` Package
This demonstrates example usage of the `wai` and `waigen` packages 

For this example, [Golang](https://go.dev/) is used as the external WASM Language to interop with for this example, although any language that compiles to WASM can be used (including [Dart Itself](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/pkg/dart2wasm/README.md)).

The Go files are located in the [wasm](./web/wasm/) folder.

To run this code, run **webdev** as usual:
```bash
webdev serve
```
